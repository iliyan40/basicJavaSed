I made a package that you can import to your project.
Simple and easy to use:

Sed.substitute(filePath,wordToFind,wordToReplace)

Use Sed.substitute() to replace a word in a text.
This method returns String type.

substituteAndApply(filePath,wordToFind,wordToReplace)
Use substituteAndApply() to replace a word in a text and edit the file at the same time.
This method does not return a String but edits the file directly.

filePath -> the path and name of the file.
wordToFind -> the word that you want to be replaced with your chosen word.
wordToReplace -> the word you want to be used to replace the other one.
All of them are case sensitive.

SRC \:
basicSED folder:
-FileEditor is used to read and write txt files.
-Sed is used to substitute or substituteAndApply. (can be added more)

textFilesForTesting folder: (those are txt files)
-Test1, Test2, Test3 are used to test substitute method.
-TestFileEditor is used to test reading functions of fileEditor.
-TestSubstituteAndApply is used to test substituteAndApply method.

test folder:
